## I have made a Maze Generator and Solver

I have used **Recursive backtracking** to generate the Maze.
Recursive backtracking is a depth-first search algorithm used for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as maze generation, pathfinding, and puzzle solving. The general approach involves exploring possible solutions recursively and backtracking when a dead end is reached.

For Getting the path, I have used **A star search** algorithm
The A* (A-star) search algorithm is a widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is particularly effective for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a goal node in a weighted graph. A* combines the advantages of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First-Search by using a heuristic to guide its search.
Here , i have used Manhattan Distance as the heuristic function.
